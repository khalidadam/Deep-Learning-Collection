# AlexNet

This repo contains implementation of __AlexNet__ architecture in PyTorch along with weight initialization.

AlexNet was introducted in 2012 in [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolution Neural Network](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) paper. It was a breakthrough model that started the Deep Learning revolution. The main __takeaways__ from the paper are: 
- Large CNNs __outperform__ other techniques significantly on large datasets like ImageNet
- CNNs utilize the __GPU__
- __ReLU__ speeds up computation significantly
- __Overfitting__ can be combated using different technqies like:
  * Dropout
  * Data augmentation
