# GoogLeNet(InceptionV1)

GoogLeNet is a Deep CNN introduced in 2014 in a  ["Going deeper with convolutions"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf) paper. The model achieved __first place__ in classification 2014 __ImageNet competition__. The key takeaways from the article are:
- Increased __depth__ and __width__ of CNN can increse the processing performance and final result 
- Smaller __filters(1x1)__ are great to control the number of channels
