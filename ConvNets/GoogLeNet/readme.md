# GoogLeNet(InceptionV1)

VGG is a Deep CNN introduced in 2014 in a  ["Very Deep Convolutional Network for Large Scale Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) paper. The model achieved __first place__ in classification 2014 __ImageNet competition__. The key takeaways from the article are:
- Increased __depth__ and __width__ of CNN can increse the processing performance and final result 
- Smaller __filters(1x1)__ are great to control the number of channels
