# ResNet
*You can find the accompanying paper review video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOuaGvxbtZo&t=261s).*

ResNet model was introduced in 2015 in a ["Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) paper. The model achieved __first place__ in __ImageNet localization and detection competition__ and also in __Coco detection and localization__. The key takeaways from the article are:
- The resiudal connections allow to deeper networks without degredetion of accuracy 
- Residual connections imporoves flow of gradient

# Architecture
The implementation contains __ResNet50__ configuration with __bottleneck building block__.

# TO-DO
- [ ] add different configurations
- [ ] convert it to .py file and add usage
